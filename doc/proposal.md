### Product Vision
This product is for a financially conscious person who wants a convenient and simple solution to track and view 
transactions. The Statement_Reader is a financial tracking tool that organizes spending statements into one
easily understood document. Unlike EveryDollar, which requires manual entry of every transaction, our 
Statement Reader will input an entire month's transactions with the upload of a PDF statement.


## Proposal
In today's world, many people struggle to keep track of their finances and understand where their money is going.
With the rise of online banking and digital transactions, it has become increasingly difficult for individuals to 
manage their finances effectively. The Statement Reader aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and convenient
way for users to track their spending and gain insights into their financial habits.

There are two main components to the Statement Reader web app. The first is a feature for users to manually track their 
transactions. This feature will allow users to input their transactions into a database and organize them into a 
convenient document. This feature helps users to have one place to compound all of their transactions from their
accounts in once place. This allows for a clearer picture of what they're spending money on.

The second component is a feature for users to upload their statements and have the app automatically parse them into
a single document for them to view. This functionality will allow users to quickly and easily view their financial 
history similar to manually inputting the transactions, except it will be done quickly and provide the user with a
compiled list of their transactions.
