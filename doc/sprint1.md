## Retro

[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good

* Exception collaboration
* Each group member independantly learned how to use the technology

### Bad

* Disliked each implementing small features depending on each other
* Learning how to properly use the Github issues

### Actionable Commitments

* As a team, we will structure tasks so that members can see individual progress
